### Installation

To have the latest version of the theme you can clone the repo directly
where you plan to start to work: 

```shell
git clone git@github.com:moxienyc/Lean.git
```

Or you can download the latest release from 
[the releases page](https://github.com/moxienyc/Moxie-Lean/releases).

Once you have the files you need to be on the theme path or theme
directory, then you need to install the `node`, `composer` and
`bower` dependencies in order to execute some utilities. You need to run
the following command from your terminal in the theme path: 

```shell
./bin/install.sh
```

**Note: Make sure to use the dot before the /bin/ directory to execute
the file inside of the theme bin directory**

You are going to be prompt you can reply with `1` or `0`, where `1` is
yes and `0` means no.

If you have any problem to run this shell script, try by copy and paste
the following commands in your terminal if the command above does not
work.

```shell
npm install && bower install && curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php && php composer.phar install && php composer.phar update && gulp js && gulp styles
```

Those commands are going to install the required dependencies of the
theme in order to allow other tools to work properly (like gulp).
